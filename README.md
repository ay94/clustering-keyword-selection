## Inter-Class Clustering of Text Data Using Dimensionality Reduction andÂ BERT

Files and data related to the [medium article](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/inter-class-clustering-of-text-data-using-dimensionality-reduction-and-bert-390a5f9954b8) on clustering using UMAP and BERT. 

All necessary code can be found in the **clustering** notebook. The precomputed embeddings are contained in the **abstract_embeddings** pickle object, and the already clustered data can either be accessed from the **dict_list** or directly in the **clusters** CSV file.

Refer to the code and Medium article for all the steps taken and the general idea!

Method highly inspired by [Top2Vec](https://github.com/ddangelov/Top2Vec), this is my own attempt at an implementation and introduction of a small change in the pipeline.
